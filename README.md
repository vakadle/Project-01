   [+2] Include more than 16 passages
    [+1] Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item (passport)
    [+1] Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa) (travel skill by reading travel guide)
    [+1] Keep track of visited passages and only display the description when visiting for the first time (or requested) (I track visited places by storing them into variables: true/false, in this case I use different approach with if / else conditions)
